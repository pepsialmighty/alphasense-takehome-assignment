### React Client

#### > Client visuals

- [x] Render a full page application with three panels
- [x] Navigation panel shows a list of channels
- [x] Message list panel shows a list of message bodies for one channel
- [x] Editor panel shows a text area input
  - [x] Editor panel is hidden if there is no channel selected
  - [x] Editor has a submit button
  - [x] Submit button is disabled if there is no text in message body

#### > Interactions

- [x] Clicking a channel in navigation panel selects that channel
- [x] Entering text in editor and clicking submit adds message to the currently selected
      channel
- [x] Submitting editor clears input
- [x] Switching channels clears input

#### > State

- [x] Channel list
  - [x] Channel list is loaded once on loading the application
- [x] Channel selection
  - [x] Initially no channel is selected
- [x] Selected channel and messages
  - [x] There is no upfront loading of messages
  - [x] Messages already in local state are showed immediately
  - [x] Messages are loaded from remote on channel selection and updated to
        screen
  - [x] Messages are also stored to local state after loading the from remote

#### > Messages

- [x] Editing is not required, only creation
- [x] Upon submitting a message to a channel that message is available for other
      users
- [x] Submitting user sees message in message list after submitting
  - [x] Render created message in the list immediately before refreshing from backend

#### > No error handling required

### NodeJS backend

- [x] Channel and message storage can be an in-memory database (global variable etc).
- [x] On server start, storage is populated with a fixed set of empty channels
- [x] GET endpoint for querying channels
  - GET `http://<backend>/channels`
- [x] GET endpoint for querying channelâ€™s messages
  - GET `http://<backend>/messages/<channel>`
- [x] POST endpoint for submitting new messages to a channel
  - POST `http://<backend>/<channel>`
  - Body
    - Message text
